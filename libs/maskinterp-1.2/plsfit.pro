function plsfit, raw,mask,debug=debug
;NAME: 	plsfit
;PURPOSE:  
;	An interpolating function implementing a plane surface fit.
;	Given an image data array(2D) and a mask(of the same size)
;	which identifies a bad pixel on the image with a 0 and a 
;	good pixel with a 1, this function attempts to correct the
;       bad pixel at the center of the grid.  
;EXPLANATION:
;	Fit a plane to the good data.  By plugging in the coordinates 
;	of the centered pixel as variables to the fitted planar 
;	equation, the interpolated value of the centered pixel is 
;	obtained.
;	   Planar equation: z = ax + by + c
;	   Let x = a vector of the x coordinates of the good pixels,
;	       y = a vector of the y coordinates of the good pixels,
;	       z = a vector of the image data corresponding to (x,y), 
;	 and coefs = a vector containing the coefficients: [c a b].
;       We obtain the following linear system.
;	    	z = [1 x y]*coefs
;	Call matrix [1 x y], matrix A with m rows and n colums.  
;	m must be at least 3 in order for the system to be
;       solvable.  Since m corresponds to the number of good
;	pixels in the image, m may be greater than n, indicating that 
;       the matrix may have too many constraints. We use the method of 
;	least squares to find the best fit coefficients.
;               coefs = inverse(transpose(A)*A)*z
;	   Let (xo,yo) be the coordinates of the centered pixel.
; 	        result = c + a*xo + b*yo
;CALLING SEQUENCE:
;	Result = plsfit(raw,mask)
;INPUTS:raw	A 2-dimensional data array.
;	mask	A 2-dimensional integral array of the same size as 
;		raw data.  Allowed values are 1 and 0. 1 specifies
;		that the corresponding pixel in rawdata is good.
;		0 specifies that it is bad.
;KEYWORDS:
;	debug	Set to 1 to show the coeficients of the planar equation.
;OUTPUT:str     A structure with the following fields:
;		image 	Value of the corrected bad pixel.
;		fixed	Set to 1 if the bad pixel is corrected, 0 otherwise.
;EXAMPLE:
;	raw = indgen(5,7)	;create image data array
;	raw(2,3) = -99
;	mask = intarr(5,7)+1	;create mask
;	mask(2,3) = 0
;	p = plsfit(raw,mask)
